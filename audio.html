  <CENTER>   Auditrorium is one of the best place in the school other than the classroom.  It must be in every students heart because of the environment on the 
auditorium is always great.  Celebrating events in auditorium is not the only thing that can be done there.  It is also very useful for teaching class .</CENTER>
